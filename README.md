# file_disguise_rep
🎭 Mask a file with another file, written in Python3 🐍
ℹ️ Execute the main.py file with command line arguments OR run the .exe file directly 🏃‍♂️‍➡️
📁 Takes three file paths as input 🗃️
Mask file: preferably an .jpg file
File you want to hide: preferably a .zip file
Output adress: 
📖🔍 Reads the first two in binary 🔎📖
Both of these files get written onto the same output file adress, the third input
MAKE SURE THE OUTPUT PATH IS EMPTY BEFORE YOU RUN THIS PROGRAM
Because the mask file is written first, your operating system thinks 
🎭 Masks the first file over the second file 👺
